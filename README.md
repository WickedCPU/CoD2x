    - fullscreen mode: `r_fullscreen 1` (default)
- Added support for rinput (raw input for mouse movement) 
    - ![alt text](images/cod2-rinput.png)
    - `m_rinput 0` - turned off, uses Windows cursor possition to get movement (default)
    - `m_rinput 1` - raw mouse movement, dedicated thread, as external Rinput application
    - `m_rinput 2` - raw mouse movement, integrated directly into the game
    - The game is also measuring the refresh rate of the mouse:
        - ![alt text](images/cod2-rinput-hz.png)
        - `m_rinput_hz` - shows the current refresh rate of your mouse in real time

  - Client max snaps increased from 30 to 40 (`snaps 40`)
  - Client max packet value increased from 100 to 125 (`cl_maxpackets 125`)
    - This allows to send exactly 125 packets at 250FPS (instead of ~83.3)
- HWID
  - An unique hardware ID is generated for each computer
  - The HWID is used to ban cheaters on the server via commands `/banClient <clientId>` and `/unbanAll` (bans are saved in file `main\ban.txt`)
  - The HWID is replacing GUID that was generated by PunkBuster, which is no longer supported
  - The HWID is an non-zero unsigned 32-bit integer, like `560978975`
  - You can see your HWID in the game by checking cvar `/cl_hwid`
  - ![alt text](images/cod2-hwid.png)
- Added possibility to change the master via cvars
  - client: `cl_masterServer`, `cl_masterPort`
  - server: `sv_master1`, `sv_master2`, `sv_master3`

# How to install (client on Windows)
1. You need original Call of Duty 2 with version [1.3](https://www.moddb.com/games/call-of-duty-2/downloads/call-of-duty-2-pc-patch-v-13) installed.
2. Download latest version of CoD2x - [CoD2x_1.4.4.6_windows.zip](https://github.com/eyza-cod2/CoD2x/releases/download/v1.4.4.6/CoD2x_1.4.4.6_windows.zip)
3. Extract these files from the archive to the Call of Duty 2 folder, replacing any existing file:
    - 📄 mss32.dll
    - 📄 mss32_original.dll
4. Final structure should look like this:
    - 📁 Call of Duty 2
        - 📁 Docs
        - 📁 main
        - 📁 miles
        - 📁 pb
        - 📄 CoD2MP_s.exe
        - 📄 CoD2SP_s.exe
        - 📄 gfx_d3d_mp_x86_s.dll
        - 📄 gfx_d3d_x86_s.dll
        - 📄 **mss32.dll**
        - 📄 **mss32_original.dll**
        - 📄 ... (other files)
5. The archive also contains additional files that are not required to be installed:
    - 📄 CoD2x Installation and uninstallation manual.txt


# How to uninstall (client on Windows)
1. Delete the following files:
    - 📄 mss32.dll
2. Rename following file:
    - 📄 mss32_original.dll  ->  📄 mss32.dll


# How to install (server on Linux)
1. Download latest version of CoD2x - [CoD2x_1.4.4.6_linux.zip](https://github.com/eyza-cod2/CoD2x/releases/download/v1.4.4.6/CoD2x_1.4.4.6_linux.zip)
2. Extract this file from the archive to the Call of Duty 2 folder:
    - 📄 libCoD2x.so
3. Final structure should look like this:
    - 📁 Call of Duty 2
        - 📁 main
        - 📁 pb
        - 📄 cod2_lnxded
        - 📄 libCoD2x.so
4. The archive also contains additional files that are not required to be installed:
    - 📄 CoD2x Installation and uninstallation manual.txt
    - 📄 cod2_lnxded    (official 1.3 game version)
5. Update chmod for the libCoD2x.so file to be executable:
    - `chmod +x libCoD2x.so`
6. Run the game with LD_PRELOAD, for example:
    - `LD_PRELOAD=libCoD2x.so ./cod2_lnxded +exec server.cfg`
    - 🛈 Its not common that server providers support adding this, only server administrators can do that.
7. Auto-update is enabled by default. Make sure to enable UDP port 20720. If you want to disable auto-update, set `sv_update "0"` or disable UDP port 20720. On server start, the server will check for the latest version of CoD2x and download it if available. File libCoD2x.so will be replaced with the latest version. Process restart is needed to apply the update. 


# Administrator rights
Since version 1.4.4.6, the game does not require administrator rights to run if the game is located in folder outside of Program Files.

If the game is located in Program Files, you need to run the game as administrator to avoid problems with VirtualStore folder.

The VirtualStore folder is a feature introduced in Windows Vista and later to provide compatibility for legacy applications that try to write files to protected system locations, such as `C:\Program Files`. When a program without administrator rights attempts to write to these folders, Windows silently redirects the write operations to a user-specific location.

This allows older applications to run without errors, but it can cause confusion because files may not be where the application or user expects them to be. For example, config files and IWD files might end up in the VirtualStore folder instead of the actual game directory.

Possible locations for the game:
- `C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\VirtualStore\Program Files (x86)\Activision\Call of Duty 2`

Possible locations for the game in registry:
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Activision\Call of Duty 2`
- `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\VirtualStore\MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Activision\Call of Duty 2`

In CoD2x, we check for write access to the game folder on startup. If the game is located in Program Files and the user does not have write access, we show a error message box:
![cod2-write-access-error](images/cod2-write-access-error.png)

Running the game as administrator will fix this problem, but **it decreases the security of the system**. Thats why we recommend to move the game to a different folder, such as `C:\Games\Call of Duty 2` and uncheck the "Run as administrator" option and compatibility mode in the properties of the game executable, if possible.

Why its recommended to uncheck also compatibility mode?
Compatibility mode also runs the game with administrator rights.

Try to run the game without administrator and compatibility mode first, and if it works without problems, you can leave it that way. If you encounter problems with the game, you can try to run the game with compatibility mode, but you decrease the security of your system.

In registry, when the game runs with administrator rights, we are moving old values from VirtualStore to the original location, so the game always uses the latest saved values.

# Repository layout
- 📁 **bin**
    - 📁 **linux** - *Linux server binaries*
    - 📁 **windows** - *Windows game binaries from original CD with 1.3 patch applied*
- 📁 **src**
    - 📁 **linux** - *code related only for Linux server*
    - 📁 **mss32** - *code related for Windows, mimicking mss32.dll*
    - 📁 **shared** - *code shared for both Linux server and Windows version*
    - 📁 **other** - *reversed / testing code*
- 📁 **tools** - *contains external tools for coding, compiling, etc..*
- 📁 **zip** - *zip files are generated here*

To avoid source code duplication, the code that is used for both Linux and Windows is placed in `📁src / 📁shared` folder. Its primarily a server side code. 

The code that is related only for Windows version or Linux server is placed in particular folders `📁src / 📁mss32` or `📁src / 📁linux`, both sharing the shared folder.



# How the Windows mss32.dll works
CoD2MP_s.exe has following dynamic libraries:
- WINMM.dll       
- WSOCK32.dll     
- mss32.dll       <-- *hooking this library*
- d3d9.dll        
- DSOUND.dll      
- KERNEL32.dll    
- USER32.dll      
- GDI32.dll       
- ADVAPI32.dll    
- SHELL32.dll     

These libraries are loaded at runtime when the CoD2MP_s.exe is started.

File mss32.dll is a Miles Sound System dynamic link library used for audio playback.
This file is replaced with our custom mss32.dll, which exports the same functions as the original mss32.dll.

The CoD2MP_s.exe imports 364 functions from original mss32.dll:
- _AIL_set_sample_adpcm_block_size@8
- _AIL_enumerate_3D_providers@12
- _AIL_end_sample@4
- _AIL_set_3D_position@16
- ...

Our version of mss32.dll has the same exported functions as original.
These functions act as a proxy to the original functions in the original mss32.dll.
    
    [CoD2MP_s.exe]
        ↓
    [mss32.dll]            <- this file
        ↓
    [mss32_original.dll]   <- original mss32.dll

When our mss32.dll is loaded, it loads mss32_original.dll and redirect all exported functions.
It also runs patching process that modifies the game memory to fix some bugs and add new features.
